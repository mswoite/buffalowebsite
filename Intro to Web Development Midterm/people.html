                                <p class="info">F. Scott Fitzgerald is an American author. Fitzgerald spent much of his early life in Buffalo, and once a Buffalonian, always a Buffalonian. He is best known for his book "The Great Gatsby", which definitely was not based on his time in Buffalo. If he were still alive, I'm sure he would be found chugging Bud Light out of a whiffle ball bat in the parking lot of Ralph Wilson Stadium.</p>

Kelly started his Bills career by refusing to play for them and going to a league that doesn't exist anymore. Kelly has the claim to fame of being the only quarterback ever to lose 4 straight Super Bowls. </p>

He singlehandedly led the Sabres to the Stanley Cup, but the rest of the team sucked so they lost. During his time off the ice, he liked to assault journalists who question an injury he was obviously faking. </p>

He is a musician best known for his song Super Freak which you may remember as the song MC Hammer ripped off with "U Can't Touch This". This picture alone should give you a pretty clear idea as to what kind of guy he was.</p>

Despite being born in Buffalo and going to the University at Buffalo, Jacobs decided to purchase one of the Sabres biggest divisional rivals and then win a Stanley Cup with them. </p>

Singlehandedly keeping the folding table industry alive, this guy never fails to impress his drunk friends. If he is lucky, Deadspin will write an article about him.</p>
