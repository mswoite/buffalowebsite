                    <h1>History of Buffalo, New York</h1>
                    <h2>The Early Years</h2>
                    <p>In 1810 the Town of Buffalo was officially formed. It has been all downhill since. Almost immediately, Buffalo found itself in the middle of the War of 1812. As was the case with most cities back in those days, Buffalo was almost entirely burned to the ground. (Un)Luckily enough, the people of Buffalo were able to build it back up by  1816.</p>
                    <h2> The Erie Canal</h2>
                    <p>The one bright spot in Buffalo's history, the Erie Canal was completed in 1825, with Buffalo being the western end of the long canal that reached all the way from New York City. Back in these days, that was a pretty big deal, and Buffalo's population rose by 100,000 people in just 50 years. The Erie Canal contributed to the growth of Buffalo for many years until it was rendered useless by modern technology. Even still, Buffalonians are so proud of it that I was unaware it wasn't still being used until last year.</p>
                    <h2>Turn of the Century</h2>
                    <p>Buffalo started the 1900s great, with Niagara Falls providing it the capability to be the first widespread city to have electricity. Buffalo hosted the Pan American Exposition in 1901 to show off how sick the city was. Unfortunately, some buzzkill named Leon Czolgosz assassinated President William McKinley, likely out of rage that his last name was so hard to spell.</p>
                    <h2>Everything After That</h2>
                    <p>As evidenced by the population going down every year since 1950, Buffalo isn't really important anymore. Nowadays, Buffalo is famous for its humongous blizzards and bad sports teams. The most important thing to happen in Buffalo in the past 100 years was when the mayor gave Terrell Owens the key to the city. Currently, Buffalo's slogan is "at least we aren't Cleveland or Detroit".</p>
