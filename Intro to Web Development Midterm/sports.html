                    <h1>Buffalo Sports</h1>
                    <p>Buffalo is home to many unsuccessful sports teams. Let's take a closer look into their failure:</p>
                    <h2>Buffalo Bills</h2>
                    <p>The Buffalo Bills are Buffalo's National Football League team. With no thanks to Jon Bon Jovi's best efforts to move the team to Toronto, the Bills have been a mainstay in Buffalo since 1960. The Bills original owner was Ralph Wilson Jr. who somehow lived to the age of 95 despite having to watch the Bills lose 4 straight Super Bowls in the 1990s, as well as miss the playoffs for 16 years straight. If that isn't enough, the best player in franchise history is OJ Simpson. The Bills fanbase has been named one of the most loyal in sports, as only in Buffalo can you find Joe from accounting shirtless in -10 degree weather cheering on the Bills' 6-10 record. Luckily for the Bills, next year is their year, and at least they aren't the Cleveland Browns.</p>
                <h2>Buffalo Sabres</h2>
                    <p>The Buffalo Sabres are Buffalo's National Hockey League team. Since Buffalo is only 20 minutes from Canada, people actually care about hockey. The Sabres have been to two Stanley Cup Finals, and of course lost both of them. Recently, the Sabres have been found abusing the rules and losing intentionally in order to get good players. It seems to have worked, as the Sabres acquired young superstar Jack Eichel who's first gameworn jersey sold at an auction for the small price of $39,000. With the franchise in the hands of a teenager, the Sabres are starting to once again be relevant.</p>
                    <h2>Buffalo Bandits</h2>
                    <p>The good news is that this team has actually won a few championships and had the best player in the history of the sport. The bad news is that its indoor lacrosse and nobody cares. Their only notable player is John Tavares, who, despite being the Michael Jordan of indoor lacrosse, has to work as a school teacher in the offseason just to get by. </p>
